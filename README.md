# New York Times COVID-19 Data

In this repository you will see my analysis on the COVID-19 data in the form of a shiny app that produces a nice map that shows spots in the U.S where the virus has hit harder than others.

I'm leaving the getting started document in here because I used that a lot for scratch work when making the app and learning how mapview works, so I felt that deserves to stay in here.
